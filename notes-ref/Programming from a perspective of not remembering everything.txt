Programming from a perspective - where you can see the type of data you are going through without having to remember
Ex.

variant['placeholders'] is an array - but this accessing in this way doesnt tell me anything about the value being returned 
So variant['placeholders'] looks like this:
    'placeholders': [{'position': 'front', 'height': 3600, 'width': 3000}, {'position': 'back', 'height': 3600, 'width': 3000}

    What if instead of trying to remember the value returned from variant['placeholders'], i could read the var name and know the type of data it is
    Because variant['placeholders'] could be an object, it could be an array, a string, etc.

    Instead do this
    array_of_objects_Placeholders = variant['placeholders']
    The variable name now tell me its an array - I atleast know this much now

Also, make a seperate doc for keeping track of how data structures look
    Ex.

        "User_selected_product_variants looks like":
            [{'id': 81758, 'title': '18" x 15"', 'options': {'size': '18" x 15"'}, 'placeholders': [{'position': 'front', 'height': 3600, 'width': 3000}, {'position': 'back', 'height': 3600, 'width': 3000}]}, {'id': 81721, 'title': '18" x 15"', 'options': {'size': '18" x 15"'}, 'placeholders': [{'position': 'front', 'height': 3600, 'width': 3000}, {'position': 'back', 'height': 3600, 'width': 3000}]}]

    Do this so you dont have to keep printing out what the structure looks or trying to keep it in memory
